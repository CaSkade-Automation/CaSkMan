# Semantic Machine Capability and Skill Model

A formal model to describe machine capabilities and executable skills in a shared ontology. This ontology combines a variety of different so-called ontology design patterns (ODPs) that are all based on industry standards. The OPDs / standards included in this model are:
* VDI 3682
* VDI 2860
* DIN 8580
* VDI 2206
* DIN EN 61360
* ISA 88
* Web Application Description Language
* OPC UA

All these ODPs are separately maintained in our [Industry Standard ODP-Repository](https://github.com/hsu-aut/Industrial-Standard-Ontology-Design-Patterns/tree/master). 

This capability ontology can be seen as an alignment ontology that connects these standard ODPs. Figure 1 gives an overview on how these ODPs were connected to get a model that can be used to describe machines and their capabilities as well as executable skills:
