# CaSkMan examples

In this folder, you can find three example ontologies:
- A simple module without any information. It is just use as a container for capabilities and skills
- An addition skill that is accessible through an OPC UA skill interface
- A multiplication skill that is accessible through a REST skill interface

Please note that these examples were all generated using SkillUp. You can find the corresponding code examples in the [exampes directory of SkillUp](https://github.com/aljoshakoecher/skill-up/tree/master/examples).
We do not recommend to create skill descriptions manually and these examples are mostly for testing / debugging purposes.
